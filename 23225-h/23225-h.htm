<h3>SUGGESTIONS FOR PRESERVING A RECORD OF EXISTING
MONUMENTS.</h3>

  <p>When, in the opening Number of the present Volume (p. 14), we called
  the attention of our readers to the <i>Monumentarium of Exeter
  Cathedral</i>, we expressed a hope that the good services which Mr.
  Hewett had thereby rendered to all genealogical, antiquarian, and
  historical inquirers would be so obvious as to lead a number of labourers
  into the same useful field. That hope bids fair to be fully realised. In
  Vol. iii., p. 116., we printed a letter from <span class="sc">Mr.
  Peacock</span>, announcing his intention of copying the inscriptions in
  the churches and churchyards of the Hundred of Manley; and we this week
  present our readers with three fresh communications upon the subject.</p>

  <p>We give precedence to <span class="sc">Miss Bockett's</span>, inasmuch
  as it involves no general proposal upon the subject, but is merely
  expressive of that lady's willingness, in which we have no doubt she will
  be followed by many of her countrywomen to help forward the good
  work.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>In your Number for Feb. 15th, I find <span class="sc">Mr. Edward
  Peacock</span>, Jun., of Bottesford Moors, Messingham, Kirton Lindsey,
  wishes to collect church memorials for work he intends to publish. If he
  would like the accounts of monuments in the immediate neighbourhood of
  Reading, as far as I am able it would give me pleasure to send some to
  him.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Julia R. Bockett</span>.

  <p>Southcote Lodge, near Reading.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The second makes us acquainted with a plan for the publication of a
  <i>Monumenta Anglicana</i> by <span class="sc">Mr. Dunkin</span>,&mdash;a
  plan which would have our hearty concurrence and recommendation, if it
  were at all practicable; but which, it will be seen at a glance, must
  fail from its very vastness. If the <i>Monumentarium of Exeter</i>
  contains the material for half a moderate-sized octavo volume, in what
  number of volumes does <span class="sc">Mr. Dunkin</span> propose to
  complete his collection&mdash;even if a want of purchasers of the early
  volumes did not nip in the bud his praiseworthy and well-intentioned
  scheme?</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Your correspondent <span class="sc">Mr. Edw. Peacock</span>, Jun, may
  be interested in knowing that a work has some time been projected by my
  friend Mr. Alfred John Dunkin of Dartford (whose industry and antiquarian
  learning render him well fitted for the task), under the title of
  <i>Monumenta Anglicana</i>, and which is intended to be a medium for
  preserving the inscriptions in every church in the kingdom. There can be
  no doubt of the high value and utility of such a work, especially if
  accompanied by a well-arranged index of names; and I have no doubt <span
  class="sc">Mr. Peacock</span>, and indeed many others of your valued
  correspondents, will be induced to <!-- Page 218 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page218"></a>{218}</span>assist in the good
  cause, by sending memoranda of inscriptions to Mr. Dunkin.</p>

  <p class="author">L. J.

  <p>Plymouth.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The following letter from the <span class="sc">Rev. E. S.
  Taylor</span> proposes a Society for the purpose:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>I for one shall be happy to co-operate with <span class="sc">Mr.
  Peacock</span> in this useful work; and I trust that, through the
  valuable medium of "<span class="sc">Notes And Queries</span>," many will
  be induced to offer their assistance. Could not a Society be formed for
  the purpose, so that mutual correspondence might take place?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">E. S. Taylor.</span>

  <p>Martham, Norfolk.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>We doubt the necessity, and indeed the advisability, of the formation
  of any such Society.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Peacock</span> (<i>antè</i>., p. 117.) has
  already wisely suggested, that "in time a copy of every inscription in
  every church in England might be ready for reference in our National
  Library," and we have as little doubt that the MS. department of the
  British Museum is the proper place of deposit for such records, as that
  the trustees would willingly accept the charge of them on the
  recommendation of their present able and active Keeper of the
  Manuscripts. What he, and what the trustees would require, would be some
  security that the documents were what they professed to be; and this
  might very properly be accomplished through the agency of such a Society
  as <span class="sc">Mr. Taylor</span> proposes, if there did not already
  exist a Society upon whom such a duty might very safely be
  devolved:&mdash;and have we not, in the greater energy which that Society
  has lately displayed, evidence that it would undertake a duty for which
  it seems pre-eminently fitted? We allude to the Society of Antiquaries.
  The anxiety of Lord Mahon, its president, to promote the efficiency of
  that Society, has recently been made evident in many ways; and we cannot
  doubt that he would sanction the formation of a sub-committee for the
  purpose of assisting in collecting and preserving a record of all
  existing monuments, or that he would find a lack of able men to serve on
  such a committee, when he numbers among the official or active Fellows of
  the Society gentlemen so peculiarly fitted to carry out this important
  national object, as Mr. Hunter, Sir Charles Young, Mr. J. Payne Collier,
  and Mr. Bruce.</p>

<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>ON THE WORD "RACK" IN SHAKSPEARE'S TEMPEST.</h3>

  <p>As another illustration of the careless or superficial manner in which
  the meaning of Shakspeare has been sought, allow me to call attention to
  the celebrated passage in the <i>Tempest</i> in which the word "rack"
  occurs. The passage really presents no difficulty; and the meaning of the
  word, as it appears to me, might as well be settled at once and for ever.
  I make this assertion, not dogmatically, but with the view of testing the
  correctness of my opinion, that this is not at all a question of
  etymology, but entirely one of construction. The passage reads as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i8hg3">"These, our actors,</p>
      <p>As I foretold you, were all spirits, and</p>
      <p>Are melted into air, into thin air:</p>
      <p>And, like the baseless fabrick of this vision,</p>
      <p>The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,</p>
      <p>The solemn temples, the great globe itself,</p>
      <p>Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve;</p>
      <p>And, like this insubstantial pageant, faded,</p>
      <p>Leave not a rack behind."&mdash;<i>Tempest</i>, Act IV. Sc. 1.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>As I have expressed my opinion that this is not at all a question of
  etymology, I shall not say more in reference to this view of the case
  than that "rack," spelt as in Shakspeare, is a word in popular and
  every-day use in the phrase "rack and ruin;" that we have it in the term
  "rack off," as applied to wine, meaning <i>to take from the rack</i>, or,
  in other words, "to leave a rack" or <i>refuse</i> "behind," racked wine
  being wine drawn from the lees; and that it is, I believe, still in use
  in parts of England, meaning <i>remains</i> or <i>refuse</i>, as, in the
  low German, "der Wraek" means the same thing. Misled, however, by an
  unusual mode of spelling, and unacquainted with the literature of
  Shakspeare's age, certain of the commentators suggested the readings of
  <i>track</i> and <i>trace</i>; whereupon Horne Tooke remarks:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The ignorance and presumption of his commentators have shamefully
  disfigured Shakspeare's text. The first folio, notwithstanding some few
  palpable misprints, requires none of their alterations. Had they
  understood English as well as he did, they would not have quarrelled with
  his language."&mdash;<i>Diversions of Purley</i>, p. 595.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>He proceeds to show that <i>rack</i> "is merely the past tense, and
  therefore past participle, <a href="images/73_reac.png"><img
  src="images/73_reac.png" class="middle" style="height:2ex" alt="reac"
  /></a> or <a href="images/73_rec.png"><img src="images/73_rec.png"
  class="middle" style="height:2ex" alt="rec" /></a>, of the Anglo-Saxon
  verb Recan, <i>exhalare</i>, to <i>reek</i>;" and although the advocates
  of its being a particular description of light cloud refer to him as an
  authority for their reading, he treats it throughout generally as "a
  vapour, a steam, or an exhalation." But Horne Tooke, in his zeal as an
  etymologist, forgot altogether to attend to the construction of the
  passage. What is it that shall "leave not a rack behind?" A rack of what?
  Not of the baseless fabric of this vision, like which the "cloud-capp'd
  towers shall dissolve,"&mdash;not of this insubstantial pageant, like
  which they shall have faded,&mdash;but of "the cloud-capp'd towers, the
  gorgeous palaces, the solemn temples, the great globe itself." There is
  in fact a double comparison; but the construction and the meaning are
  perfectly clear, and no word will suit the passage but one that shall
  express a result common <!-- Page 219 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page219"></a>{219}</span>to the different objects enumerated. A
  cloud may be a fit object for comparison, but it is utterly
  inconsequential; while the sense required can only be expressed by a
  general term, such as <i>remains</i>, a <i>vestige</i>, or a
  <i>trace</i>.</p>

  <p>I beg now to transcribe a note Of Mr. Collier's on this
  passage:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"'Rack' is vapour, from <i>reck</i>, as Horne Tooke showed; and the
  light clouds on the face of heaven are the 'rack,' or vapour from the
  earth. The word 'rack' was often used in this way."&mdash;Coll.
  <i>Shaksp.</i>, vol. i. p. 70.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mr. Knight appears to incline to the same view; and regarding these as
  the two latest authorities, and finding in neither of them any reference
  to the question of construction, I naturally concluded that the point had
  been overlooked by the commentators. On reference, however, I found to my
  surprise, that Malone, for the very same reasons, had come to the same
  conclusion. Had Malone's argument been briefly stated by the "two latest
  and best editors," I should, of course, have had no occasion to trouble
  you with this note: and this instance, it appears to me, furnishes
  additional reasons for enforcing the principle for which I am contending;
  the neglect of it affecting, in however slight a degree, the sense or
  correctness of so important and frequently quoted a passage. For my own
  part, I should have thought that the commonest faith in Shakspeare would
  have protected any editor, whose avowed object it was to restore the
  text, from preferring in this instance, to the plain common sense of
  Malone, the more showy authority of Horne Tooke.</p>

  <p>In my last paper I wrote,&mdash;"So far as quantity is concerned, to
  eat a crocodile would be <i>no</i> more than to eat an ox." You have
  omitted the negative.</p>

  other papers known to be his in the same book. As it is my chief object

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

  <p><i>Moths called Souls.</i>&mdash;While I am upon this subject, I may
  as well mention that in Yorkshire the country-people used in my youth,
  and perhaps do still, call night-flying white moths, especially the
  <i>Hepialus humuli</i>, which feeds, while in the grub state, on the
  roots of docks and other coarse plants, "souls." Have we not in all this
  a remnant of "Psyche?"</p>

  <p class="author">F. S.

<div class="note">
  <p>[This latter paragraph furnishes a remarkable coincidence with the
  tradition from the neighbourhood of Truro (recorded by <span
  class="sc">Mr. Thoms</span> in his Folk lore of Shakspeare,
  <i>Athenæum</i> (No. 1041.) Oct. 9. 1847) which gives the name of
  <i>Piskeys</i> both to the <i>fairies</i> and to <i>moths</i>, which are
  believed by many to be <i>departed souls</i>.]</p>

  <p><i>Holy Water for the Hooping Cough</i> (vol. iii., p. 179.).&mdash;In
  one of the principal towns of Yorkshire, half a century ago, it was the
  practice for persons in a respectable class of life to take their
  children, when afflicted with the hooping cough, to a neighbouring
  convent, where the priest allowed them to drink a small quantity of holy
  water out of a silver chalice, which the little sufferers were strictly
  forbidden to touch. By Protestant, as well as Roman Catholic parents,
  this was regarded as a remedy. Is not the superstition analogous to that
  noticed by <span class="sc">Mr. Way</span>?</p>

<h3>DR. MAITLAND'S ILLUSTRATIONS AND ENQUIRIES
RELATING TO MESMERISM.</h3>

  <p>I know more than one person who would second the request that I am
  about to make through "<span class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>" to
  <span class="sc">Dr. Maitland</span>, that he would publish the remaining
  parts of his <i>Illustrations and Enquiries relating to Mesmerism</i>: he
  would do so, I know, at once, if he thought that anybody would benefit by
  them; and I can bear witness to Part I. as having been already of some
  use. It is high time that Christians should be decided as to whether or
  no they may meddle with the fearful power whose existence is is
  impossible to ridicule any longer. <span class="sc">Dr. Maitland</span>
  has suggested the true course of thought upon the subject, and promised
  to lead us along it; but it is impossible at present to use anything that
  he has said, on account of its incompleteness. In tracing the subject
  through history, <span class="sc">Dr. Maitland</span> would no doubt
  mention the "<span title="Omphalopsuchoi" class="grk"
  >&Omicron;&mu;&phi;&alpha;&lambda;&#x1F79;&psi;&upsilon;&chi;&omicron;&iota;</span>,
  or Umbilicani," of the fourteenth century, whose practices make a page
  (609.) of Waddington's <i>History of the Church</i> read like a sketch of
  Middle-age Mesmerism, contemptuously given. Also, in Washington Irving's
  <i>Life of Mahomet</i>, a belief somewhat similar to theirs is stated to
  have been preached in the seventh century (<i>Bohn's Reprint in Shilling
  Series</i>, p. 191.) by a certain Moseïlma, a false prophet.</p>

  <p>I may add that Miss Martineau's new book, <i>Letters of the
  Development of Man's Nature, by Atkinson and Martineau</i>, which cannot
  be called sceptical, for its unbelief is unhesitating, is the immediate
  cause of my writing to-day.</p>

  <p><i>Origin of St. Andrew's Cross in connexion with

  king of the Picts, a bright cross, like that whereon St. Andrew suffered,

  <p><i>Snail-eating</i> (Vol. iii., p. 207.).&mdash;Your correspondent C.
  W. B. does not seem to be aware that "a ragout of boror (snails)" is a
  regular dish with English <i>gypsies</i>. Vide Borrow's <i>Zincali</i>,
  part i. c. v.</p>

  <p>He has clearly not read Mr. Borrow's remarks on the subject:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Know then, O Gentile, whether thou be from the land of Gorgios
  (England), or the Busné (Spain), that the very gypsies, who consider a
  ragout of snails a delicious dish, will not touch an eel because it bears
  a resemblance to a snake; and that those who will feast on a roasted
  hedgehog could be induced by no money to taste a squirrel!"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Having tasted of roasted hotchiwitchu (hedgehog) myself among the
  "gentle Rommanys," I can bear witness to its delicate fatness; and though
  a ragout of snails was never offered for my acceptance, I do not think
  that those who consider (as most "Gorgios" do) stewed eels a delicacy
  ought to be too sever on "Limacotrophists!"</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Hermes</span>.

  <p><i>Snail-eating.</i>&mdash;Perhaps you will permit me to remark, in
  reference to the communication of C.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;B., that snails are taken
  medicinally occasionally, and are supposed to be extremely strengthening.
  I have known them eagerly sought after for the meal of a consumptive
  patient. As a matter of taste, too, they are by <!-- Page 222 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page222"></a>{222}</span>some considered quite
  epicurean. A gentleman whom I used to know, was in the constant habit as
  he passed through the fields, of picking up the white slugs that lay in
  his way, and swallowing them with more relish than he would have done had
  they been oysters.</p>

  <p>That snails make a no inconsiderable item in the bill of fare of
  gypsies, and other wanderers, I proved while at Oxford, some time ago;
  for passing up Shotover Hill, in the parish of Headington, I unexpectedly
  came upon a camp of gypsies who were seated round a wood fire enjoying
  their Sunday's dinner: this consisted of a considerable number of large
  snails roasted on the embers, and potatoes similarly cooked. On inquiry,
  I was told by those who were enjoying their repast, that they were
  extremely good, and were much liked by people of their class, who made a
  constant practice of eating them. I need hardly say that I received a
  most hospitable invitation to join in the feast, which I certainly
  declined.</p>

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>HENRY SMITH.</h3>

  <p>In Marsden's <i>History of the Early Puritans</i> (a work recently
  published, which will well repay perusal) there occurs (pp. 178, 179.)
  the following notice of Henry Smith:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Henry Smith was a person of good family, and well connected; but
  having some scruples, he declined preferment, and aspired to nothing
  higher than the weekly Lectureship of St. Clement Danes. On a complaint
  made by Bishop Aylmer, Whitgift suspended him, and silenced for a while
  probably the most eloquent preacher in Europe. His contemporaries named
  him the Chrysostom of England. His church was crowded to excess; and
  amongst his hearers, persons of the highest rank, and those of the most
  cultivated and fastidious judgment, were content to stand in the throng
  of citizens. His sermons and treatises were soon to be found in the hands
  of every person of taste and piety: they passed through numberless
  editions. Some of them were carried abroad, and translated into Latin.
  They were still admired and read at the close of nearly a century, when
  Fuller collected and republished them. Probably the prose writing of
  this, the richest period of genuine English literature, contains nothing
  finer than some of his sermons. They are free, to an astonishing degree,
  from the besetting vices of his age&mdash;vulgarity, and quaintness, and
  affected learning; and he was one of the first English preachers who,
  without submitting to the trammels of a pedantic logic, conveyed in
  language nervous, pure, and beautiful, the most convincing arguments in
  the most lucid order, and made them the ground-work of fervent and
  impassioned addresses to the conscience."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Would it not be desirable, as well in a literary as a theological
  point of view, that any extant sermons of so renowned a divine should be
  made accessible to general readers? At present they are too rare and
  expensive to be largely useful. A brief <i>Narrative of the Life and
  Death of Mr. Henry Smith</i> (as it is for substance related by Mr.
  Thomas Fuller in his <i>Church History</i>), which is prefixed to an old
  edition (1643) of his sermons in my possession, concludes in these

<h2>Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Owen Glendower.</i>&mdash;Some of your Cambrian correspondents
  might, through your columns, supply a curious and interesting desideratum
  in historical genealogy, by contributing a pedigree, authenticated as far
  as practicable by dates and authorities, and including collaterals, of
  <span class="sc">Owen Glendower</span>, from his ancestor Griffith
  Maelor, Lord of Bromfield, son of Madoc, last Prince of Powys, to the
  extinction of Owen's male line.</p>

  <p>All Cambrian authorities are, I believe, agreed in attributing to Owen
  the lineal male representation of the sovereigns of Powys; but I am not
  aware that there is any printed pedigree establishing in detail, on
  authentic date, his descent, and that of the collaterals of his line;
  while uncertainty would seem to exist as to one of the links in the chain
  of deduction, as to the fate of his sons and their descendants, if any,
  as well as to the marriages and representatives of more than one of his
  daughters.</p>

  <p>I have in vain looked for the particulars I have indicated in Yorke's
  <i>Royal Tribes of Wales</i>; in the <i>Welsh Heraldic Visitation
  Pedigrees</i>, lately published by the Welsh MSS. Society, under the
  learned editorship of the late Sir Samuel Meyrick; and in the valuable
  contributions to the genealogy of the Principality to be found in the
  <i>Landed Gentry</i> and the <i>Peerage and Baronetage</i> of Mr.
  Burke,&mdash;a pedigree, in other respects admirable, in the <i>Landed
  Gentry</i> of a branch of the dynasty of Powys, omitting the intermediate
  descents in question.</p>

  <p><i>Meaning of Gig-Hill.</i>&mdash;Can any of your readers favour me
  with an explanation of the following matter in local topography? There
  are two places in the neighbourhood of Kingston-on-Thames distinguished
  by the name of <i>Gig-Hill</i><a name="footnotetag3"
  href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, although there is no indication of
  anything in the land to warrant the name.</p>

<p><!-- Page 223 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page223"></a>{223}</span></p>

  <p>Are there any instances to be met with where the place of punishment
  by the stocks or pillory in olden times, was known by that name?</p>

  <p>There was a king of Brittany who resigned his crown, and obtained the
  honours of canonisation as Saint Giguel, in the seventh century. St.
  Giles, who died about the sixth century, might, perhaps, have had some
  connexion with those who are traditionally believed to have been punished
  on the spot; that is, if we judge by his clients, who locate themselves
  under the sanctity of his name as a "Guild" or fraternity in London.</p>

  <p>There is, however, a curious use by Shakspeare of the word gig. It
  occurs in <i>Love's Labour's Lost</i>, Act V. Sc. I.:</p>

  <p>Holofernes says,</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"What is the figure?"</p>

  <p><i>Moth.</i> Horns.</p>

  <p><i>Holofernes.</i> Thou disputest like an infant. Go, whip thy
  gig."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I submit this matter, as local names have often their origin in
  religious associations or in proverbial philosophy.</p>

  <p>It has been suggested that <i>giggle</i>, as a mark of the derision to
  which the culprit was exposed, might so become corrupted.</p>

  <p>If the term be connected with the punishment, it would be, doubtless,
  one of general application. The smallest contribution will be thankfully
  received.</p>

  Hamilton, he is described as son of Sir Frederick Hamilton, Knt., by
  Sidney, daughter and heiress of Sir John Vaughan, Knt.; and that the said
  Dame Sidney Hamilton was descended from an honourable line of ancestors,
  one of whom, Sir Will Sidney, was Chamberlain to Henry II., another of

  </div>
  <p>The meaning of all which is obvious, except of the words "Orthodoxus
  Itermus:" and I should be glad to have this unscanning doggrel
  translated. It has been conjectured that <i>Itermus</i> must be derived
  from <i>iter</i>, and hence that Burroughs may have been a
  <i>traveller</i>, or possibly <i>an orthodox itinerant preacher</i>:
  surely there can be no punning reference to <i>a journeyman</i>! The
  lines have been submitted, in vain, to some high literati in Oxford.</p>

  commentators of the day, Mr. Hunter, who in his <i>New Illustrations</i>,
  vol. ii. p. 263., after quoting "potions of eysell" from the sonnet,
  says, "This shows it was not any river so called, but some desperate
  drink. The word occurs often in a sense in which <i>acetum</i> is the
  best representative, associated with verjuice and vinegar. It is the term
  used for one ingredient of the bitter potion given to our Saviour on the
  cross, about the composition of which the commentators are greatly
  divided. Thus the eighth prayer of the Fifteen Oos in the <i>Salisbury
  Primer</i>, 1555, begins thus: 'O Blessed Jesu, sweetness of heart and
  ghostly pleasure of souls, I beseech thee for the bitterness of the
  <i>aysell</i> and gall that thou tasted and suffered for me in thy

<h3>THE MISTLETOE ON THE OAK.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ii., pp. 163. 214.; Vol. iii., p. 192.)</p>

  <p>From having been a diligent searcher for the mistletoe on the oak, I
  may be allowed to make a few remarks upon the question. Is it ever found
  now on other trees? Now, it not only occurs abundantly on other trees,
  but it is exceedingly rare on the oak. This may be gathered from the
  following list, in which numbers have been used to express comparative
  frequency, as near as my observations enable me to form a
  judgment:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

      <div class="linenum">1</div><p>Robinia</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>From this it would appear that notwithstanding the <span
  class="sc">British Oak</span> grows everywhere, it is at present only
  favoured by the companionship of the mistletoe in equal ratio with two
  comparatively recently introduced trees. Indeed such objection does this
  parasite manifest to the brave old tree, even in his teens, that,
  notwithstanding a newly-planted line of mixed trees will become speedily
  attacked by it, the oak is certain to be left in his pride alone.</p>

  <p>I have, however, seen the mistletoe on the oak in two instances during
  my much wandering about amid country scenes, especially of Gloucester and
  Worcester, two great mistletoe counties. One was pointed out to me by my
  friend, Mr. Lees, from whom we may expect much valuable information on
  this subject, in his forthcoming edition of the <i>Botanical
  Looker-out</i>&mdash;it was on a young tree, perhaps of fifty years, in
  Eastnor Park, on the Malvern chain. The other example is at
  Frampton-on-Severn, to which the President of the Cotteswold Naturalists'
  Club, T.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;L. Baker, Esq., and myself, were taken by Mr. Clifford, of
  Frampton. The tree is full a century old, and the branch, on which was a
  goodly bunch of the parasite, numbered somewhere about forty years. That
  the plant is propagated by seeds there can, I think, be but little doubt,
  as the seeds are so admirably adapted for the peculiar circumstances
  under which alone they can propagate; and the want of attention to the
  facts connected therewith, is probably the cause why the propagation of
  the mistletoe by artificial means is usually a failure.</p>

  <p>I should be inclined to think that the mistletoe never was abundant on

<h3>UNIVERSALITY OF THE MAXIM, "LAVORA COME

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iii., p. 188.)</p>

  <p>I have not been able to trace this sentence to its source, but it
  would most probably be found in that admirable book, <i>Monosinii Floris
  Italicæ Linguæ</i>, 4to, Venet., 1604; or in Torriano's <i>Dictionary of
  Italian Proverbs and Phrases</i>, folio, Lond., 1666, a book of which
  Duplessis doubts the existence! Most of Jeremy Taylor's citations from
  the Italian are proverbial phrases. Your correspondent has probably
  copied the phrase as it stands in Bohn's edition of the <i>Holy Living
  and Dying</i>, but there is a trifling variation as it stands in the
  first edition of <i>Holy Living</i>, 1650:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The universality of this maxim, in ages and countries remote from each
  other, is remarkable. Thus we find it in the <span

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A wise man should think upon knowledge and wealth as if he were
  undecaying and immortal. He should practise duty as if he were seized by

  <p>Where the author of the <i>Voyage autour de ma Chambre</i>, Jean
  Xavier Maitre, stumbled upon it, or whether it was a spontaneous thought,
  does not appear; but in his pleasing little book, <i>Lettres sur la

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>The allusion in the first stanza of <i>In Memoriam</i> is, I think, to
  Shelley. The doctrine referred to is common to him and many other poets;
  but he perhaps inculcates it more frequently than any other. (See
  <i>Queen Mab</i> sub finem. <i>Revolt of Islam</i>, canto xii. st. 17.
  <i>Adonais</i>, stanzas 39. 41. et passim.) Besides this, the phrase
  "clear harp" seems peculiarly applicable to Shelley, who is remarkable
  for the simplicity of his language.</p>

  <p><i>Tennyson's In Memoriam.</i>&mdash;The word <i>star</i> applies in
  poetry to all the heavenly bodies; and therefore, to the <i>crescent
  moon</i>, which is often near enough to the sun to be within or to be
  <i>encircled</i> by, the crimson colour of the sky about sunset; and the
  sun may, figuratively, be called <i>father</i> of the moon, because he
  dispenses to her all the light with which she shines; and, moreover,
  because <i>new</i>, or waxing moons, must <i>set</i> nearly in the same
  point of the horizon as the sun; and because that point of the horizon in
  which a heavenly body sets, may, figuratively, be called its
  <i>grave</i>; therefore, I believe the last two lines of the stanza of
  the poem numbered lxxxvii., or 87, in Tennyson's <i>In Memoriam</i>,
  quoted by W.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;H., to mean simply&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Head of the Saviour</i> (Vol. iii., p. 168.).&mdash;The
  correspondent who inquires about the "true likeness" of the Saviour
  exposed in some of the London print-shops, is not perhaps aware that
  there is preserved in the church of St. Peter's at Rome a much more
  precious and genuine portrait than the one to which he alludes&mdash;a
  likeness described by its possessors as "far more sublime and venerable
  than any other, since it was neither painted by the hands of men nor
  angels, but by the divinity himself who makes both men and angels." It is
  not delineated upon wood or canvass, ivory, glass, or stucco, but upon "a
  pocket handkerchief lent him by a holy woman named Veronica, to wipe his
  face upon at the crucifixion" (Aringhi, <i>Roma Subterran.</i>, vol. ii.
  p. 543.). When the handkerchief was returned it had this genuine portrait
  imprinted on its surface. It is now one of the holiest of relics
  preserved in the Vatican basilica, where there is likewise a magnificent
  altar constructed by Urban VIII., with an inscription commemorating the
  fact, a mosaic above, illustrative of the event, and a statue of the holy
  female who received the gift, and who is very properly inscribed in the
  Roman catalogue of saints under the title of <span class="sc">St.
  Veronica</span>. All this is supported by "pious tradition," and attested
  by authorities of equal value to those which establish the identity of
  St. Peter's chair. The only difficulty in the matter lies in this, that
  the woman Veronica never had any corporeal existence, being no other than
  the name by which the picture itself was once designated, viz., the <span
  class="sc">Vera Icon</span>, or "True Image" (Mabillon, <i>Iter.
  Ital.</i>, p. 88.). This narrative will probably relieve your
  correspondent from the trouble of further inquiries by enabling him to
  judge for himself whether "there is any truth" about the other true
  image.</p>

  <p>In your 70th Number I perceived that some correspondent asked, "What

  some time past in the print-shops?" I ask the same question. True or
  false, I found in a work entitled <i>The Antiquarian Repertory</i>, by
  Grose, Astle, and others, vol. iii., an effigy of our Saviour, much
  inferior in all respects to the above, with the following
  attached:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"This present figure is the similitude of our Lord <span
  class="over">IHV</span>, oure Saviour imprinted in amirvld by the
  predecessors of the greate turke, and sent to the Pope Innosent the 8. at
  the cost of the greate turke for a token for this cawse, to redeme his
  brother that was taken presonor."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This was painted on board. The Rev. Thomas Thurlow, of Baynard's Park,
  Guildford, has another painted on board with a like inscription, to the
  best of my recollection: his has a date on it, I think.</p>

  <p>Pope Innocent VIII. was created Pope in 1484, and died in 1492.</p>

  <p>The variation in the three effigies is an argument against the truth
  of the story, or the two on board must have been ill-executed. That in
  the shops is very beautiful.</p>

  was ever published, and what has become of the manuscripts.</p>

  <p>I believe the late Sir James Allen Park wrote his life, but whether
  for public or private circulation I cannot tell.</p>

  <p>The late George Steevens had a relative, a Mrs. Collinson, and
  daughters who lived with him at Hampstead, and with him when he died, in
  Jan. 1800. Miss Collinson married a Mr. Pyecroft, whose death, I think,
  is in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> for this month: perhaps the
  Pyecroft family may give information respecting the manuscripts.</p>

  <p>"The house he lived in at Hampstead, called the Upper Flask, was
  formerly a place of public entertainment near the summit of Hampstead
  Hill. Here Richardson sends his Clarissa in one of her escapes from
  Lovelace. Here, too, the celebrated Kit-Cat Club used to meet in the
  summer months; and here, after it became a private abode, the no less
  celebrated George Steevens lived and died."&mdash;Vide Park's
  <i>Hampstead</i>, pp. 250. 352.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I just recollect Mr. Steevens, who was very kind to us, as children.
  My mother, who is an octogenarian, remembers him well, and says he always
  took a nosegay, tied to the top of his cane, every day to Sir Joseph

  such a mistake should arise; the names are quite unlike, and several
  lines distant from one another. Such forgetfulness is not very uncommon
  in poets, especially those of the quickest and liveliest spirit. It is
  the old mistake of Bentley and other commentators, to think that whatever
  is wrong must be spurious. These, too, we must recollect, are fictitious
  characters.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous.</h2>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</h3>

  <p>Agreeing with Mr. Lower, that they who desire to know the truth as to
  the earlier periods of our national history, will do wisely to search for
  it among the mists and shadows of antiquity, and rather collect it for
  themselves out of the monkish chronicles than accept the statements of
  popular historiographers, we receive with great satisfaction the addition
  to our present list of translations of such chronicles, which Mr. Lower
  has given us in <i>The Chronicle of Battel Abbey from 1066 to 1176, now
  first translated, with Notes, and an Abstract of the subsequent History
  of the Establishment</i>. The original Chronicle, which is preserved
  among the Cottonian MSS., though known to antiquaries and historians, was
  never committed to the press until the year 1846, when it was printed by
  the <i>Anglia Christiana Society</i> from a transcript made by the late
  Mr. Petrie. Mr. Lower's translation has been made from that edition; and
  though undertaken by him as an illustration of local history, will be
  found well deserving the perusal of the general reader, not only from the
  light it throws upon the Norman invasion and upon the <!-- Page 231
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page231"></a>{231}</span>history of the
  abbey founded by the Conqueror in fulfilment of his vow, but also for the
  pictures it exhibits of the state of society during the period which it
  embraces.</p>

  <p>GILBERT'S COPIOUS SERIES OF PAMPHLETS on the ROMAN CATHOLIC QUESTION;
  containing Important Documents of Permanent Historical Interest having
  Reference to the Re-establishment of the CATHOLIC HIERARCHY IN ENGLAND,
  1850-1.</p>

  <p>The Editor of these Pamphlets deems it almost superfluous to dwell on
  the paramount importance of every respectable family possessing this
  volume of very special present and permanent interest. During the
  discussion of the exciting matters now at issue in this all-absorbing
  question, there can be no questioning the well-recognised fact that the
  possession of this copious and cheap volume is essential to every
  thoughtful and inquiring person in our beloved country. To enable those
  who are as yet unaware of the immense mass of interesting and important
  documents there are in its pages, <span class="sc">an Index of its
  Contents is issued for Gratuitous Distribution</span>&mdash;this will
  abundantly testify to the fact; and the Editor, in conclusion, thinks it
  only necessary to state that, with scarcely an exception, the whole of
  the documents are printed, verbatim, as they originally appeared, and in
  very numerous cases they have had the additional advantage of the direct
  and special revision of the authors.</p>

  <p>The Editor deems it necessary to state his conviction that all the
  important facts and documents relative to the "Roman Catholic Question"
  have appeared in the pages of these Pamphlets. Doubtless, during the
  progress of the Ecclesiastical Titles Assumption Bill through the houses
  of parliament many speeches of interest will be made; still the Editor
  thinks they will, to a considerable extent, be merely elaborations of the
  materials already in these pages, devoid of original facts or documents.
  Should, however, on the conclusion of the debates, the Editor's opinions
  undergo a change, he will issue the results in the form of an Appendix to
  the present volume.</p>

  <p>*** Any persons who may wish to possess the Series or sheet containing
  any specific article particularised in the Index, will be at liberty to
  purchase it separately, on One Penny or Three-half-pence each sheet
  respectively, or at one penny each extra post-free, through the
